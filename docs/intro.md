# 👋 Welcome to **paperviz**

**Paperviz** is a Python library for generating **publication-quality visualizations**, **LaTeX tables**, and **figure layouts** with minimal code and maximum consistency.

It’s designed for researchers submitting to conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICML — where presentation matters, and time is tight.
