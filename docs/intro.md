**Paperviz** is a Python library for generating **publication-ready visualizations**, **LaTeX tables**, and **subfigure
layouts** — with minimal code and consistent style. 

It’s built for AI/ML researchers targeting NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICML and beyond — where *presentation matters*, and time
is tight. No more LaTeX hacks, manually resizing plots, or formatting inconsistencies. Just clean results, fast.

Head over to the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/lars-quaedvlieg/paperviz) to get started, explore the code, or contribute!
